I am a second-year Master's student at [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, where I am advised by [Professor Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/). Currently, I work on using neural-symbolic methods to improve probabilistic reasoning in language models.
My current interests are in NLP

Before my Master's, I obtained my BS in Computer Science and Mathematics from Vanderbilt University. There, I conducted research in computer vision with [Professor Daniel Work](https://lab-work.github.io/about/) to build vehicle tracking systems for [I-24 MOTION](https://i24motion.org/).

During my undergraduate, I also minored in Art History, specializing in European art from the Renaissance to modern times.
