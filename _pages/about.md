I am currently a second-year Master's student working with [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/). 

Before my Master's, I obtained my BS in Computer Science and Mathematics from Vanderbilt University where I conducted computer vision research at the [Work Research Group](https://lab-work.github.io/) and was advised by [Professor Daniel Work](https://lab-work.github.io/about/). I also completed a minor in Art History, concentrating on European art from the Renaissance through the 21st Century.
