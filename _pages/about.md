Hi there! I am a second-year Master's student at [Center for Language and Speech Processing](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/) at Johns Hopkins University, advised by [Professor Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/). My current research focuses on commonsense and probabilistic reasoning of language models. Lately, I find myself asking: what do language models learn when they learn language?

More broadly, I am interested in the interpretability and reasoning capabilities of language models, as well as how computational cognitive science can both advance these areas and benefit from the insights they provide.

Back in undergraduate, I double majored in Computer Science and Mathematics at Vanderbilt University. There, I worked on object detection and tracking with [Professor Daniel Work](https://lab-work.github.io/about/), developing vehicle tracking systems for [I-24 MOTION](https://i24motion.org/). This interest correlates with my minor in Art History, where I specialized in European art from the Renaissance to modern times.
